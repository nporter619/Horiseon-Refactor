Horiseon Refactor

Description: 
This application cleaned up the code to make it more accessible and user friendly. I used semantic elements to order and help making read the html file easier. This solves the problem of unecessary and messy html and css files and makes it easier to read for the next person to possibly change. My motivation for this project was to refactor and clean up the code. I learned how to take out unecessary files and how to be more specific with semantic elements in HTML. I also learned how to better sequentially order specific elements and the use of alt attributes.
